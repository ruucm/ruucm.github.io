        On video side, it is always difficult to jump the point directly you
        want. If you find a just example line of code, watching video could be
        terrible experiences. On post side, it is easy to find information but

        ton of times for finding why their project don't excuted like the

        I had to offer CMS(Content Management System) with student's dashboard.

        And I need to collect latest resources for students. But we had only one

        problem.
